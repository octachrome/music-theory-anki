Generates Anki cards for learning music theory - work in progress.

How to use
----------

Run one of the scripts, e.g:

    node major-keys.js

Create a deck for the cards. In the deck options, set Order to "Show new cards in random order", and disable "Bury related cards until the next day" (otherwise you will only see one type of card each day).

Create a note type in Anki with the required fields (displayed by the tool) and whatever cards you want.

Copy the files in `./media` into the `collection.media` directory within the [Anki data directory](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#files).

Import the generated notes:

- Click File menu, click Import...
- Choose `major-keys.txt` generated by the script
- On the next dialog, choose the correct card type, deck, and enable Allow HTML in fields
- Click Import
